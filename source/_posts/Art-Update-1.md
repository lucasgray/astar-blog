Welcome to the first Art/Design update!  I've been busy on Upwork trying to find an artist interested in the theme.  So far I've been working with somebody based in Poland.

It has been really interesting trying to figure out something that'll work with what we're trying to do, and really rounding out the story.  It's interesting to see the story impact the art, which impacts the game.

Here are some really early sketches and introductory screens.  Stay tuned for more!  We are going to focus on a few illustrated banners, revamping the logo, and then moving on to the loot items and tower defense sprites.
