Okay, time for a good old fashioned showdown!  I went for a run today with my $450 Garmin Forerunner 920xt and my phone running ASTAR.

How closely would they agree?  Would ASTAR be all over the place?  Let's see the results!

Not bad garmin, not bad.  Such nice straight lines though :)

I did a pretty poor job of starting/stopping them at the same time, but as you can see, within 6 secs/mi of each other - not too bad.
