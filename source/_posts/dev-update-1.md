## What is this?

ASTAR is the working title (haha, as if we'll change it) for an augmented reality fitness game played on your phone.  ASTAR is inspired by Zombies! Run, Run An Empire, Stranger Things, and of course, Pokemon Go.  

While we're still sorting out the details of how the game will play out, the story goes like this... 

The year is 2032 and AI (the Bots) have taken over.  Humanity is relegated to the last few brave individuals with enough speed and stamina not to get caught.  Your goal is to go for a supply run to gather resources for your hideout team, and prevent your hideout from being taken over by the AI militia.  You'll find supples (food, gas, ammo) during your run/ride, and afterwards, come back to fortify your base and handle any attacks tower-defense style (not sure on gameplay yet, but that's the current idea).  In order to gather supplies, you'll have to check the map before your run, and make sure to run/ride past the items that show up on your radar!

We're planning on both a single player mode and a co-op mode.

Here is a really raw/early video to give you an idea.
